**Repository Overview**

Welcome to the official repository for the thesis titled "Climate Risk Through the Looking Glass: 
An Exploratory Analysis of Whether Climate Risks Are Priced into the Swedish Stock Market Using News-Based Indices and Asset Pricing Models." 
This repository is a collection of the code used during the development and analysis stages of the thesis. The primary goal of sharing 
this repository is to provide a resource for other researchers and scholars who are exploring similar themes in financial economics, particularly 
those focused on the intersection of climate change and asset pricing. 

**Thesis Objective**

The objective of this thesis was to investigate the extent to which climate-related risks are factored into the valuations of companies listed on 
the Swedish stock market. By employing news-based indices and various asset pricing models.

**Repository Contents**

Below is an overview of the components included in this repository:

Key word selection script: This outline the gathering and preprocessing of data from various authoritative reports. The scripts employ TF-IDF analysis to extract 
relevant keywords for sourcing articles from selected newspapers. The repository also includes authoritative reports used in the study, which are available for 
public review and replication of the analysis.

LDA Analysis script: Central to my research, this script includes textual analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to understand thematic structures within 
financial news. Please note that the actual articles are not included due to copyright restrictions.

Beta Estimation Script: This script calculates the beta values of stocks, assessing their volatility relative to the market. This is a critical step in 
quantifying the risk profile of individual securities in the context of climate-related financial analysis. 

Portfolio Division and Alpha Estimation Script: This script divides stocks into portfolios based on their beta estimates and calculates the alpha of 
these portfolios. Alpha estimation is used to measure the active return on an investment, identifying the performance of a portfolio relative to a benchmark.

Portfolio Characteristics Calculation Script: This script calculates various characteristics of portfolios, focusing on CO2 emissions, financial measures, and 
E-scores. It computes averages and other statistical measures for these variables, and evaluates the return and significance of these returns for each portfolio. 

The raw financial data is available upon request.

**How to Use This Repository**

Researchers can clone the code in this repository to replicate the study or to modify the approaches for their own analysis. It is advised to carefully review the 
documentation provided for each script to understand the setup and dependencies required to run the analyses.
